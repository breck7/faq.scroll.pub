<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Introduction to Two Dimensional Languages</h1>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Scroll Notation is a subset of a class of languages called two dimensional languages.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">One dimensional languages assume a one dimensional array of bits with a single read head</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Two dimensional languages break those assumptions. There may be multiple read heads that</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Scroll Notation is a middle ground that utilitizes ideas from the two dimensional language</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Scroll Notation Spec</h1>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">The Data Structure</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The basic structure of a Scroll Notation object is as follows:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">interface TreeNode {
  parent: &TreeNode
  words: string[]
  children: TreeNode[]
}</code>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">No Syntax Errors</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">All documents are valid Scroll Notation documents. Like binary notation, there are no syntax errors in Scroll Notation. For every possible string <em>abc</em>:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">new TreeNode(abc).toString() === abc</code>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Errors can only occur at a higher semantic level in <em>Tree Languages</em>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Isomorphism to Spreadsheets</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A program in Scroll Notation is isomorphic to a spreadsheet. A single row is a node. Words are in cells. You can make a row a child of the row above it by indenting it with an additional blank cell in the head.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 class="scrollParagraph">Special Symbols</h2>
<p class="scrollParagraph">A Scroll Notation object is a sequence of bits/bytes/characters(hereafter abbreviated as chars). Scroll Notation requires the definition of 3 special chars, which turn an otherwise unstructured linear sequence of chars into a structured recursive tree object.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Those 3 special chars are:</p>
<ul ><li >nodeBreakSymbol</li>
<li >wordBreakSymbol</li>
<li >edgeSymbol</li></ul>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><strong>nodeBreakSymbol</strong> delimits nodes (lines), <strong>wordBreakSymbol</strong> delimits words (cells), and <strong>edgeSymbol</strong> is used to indicate the parent/child relationship between nodes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">With just nodeBreakSymbol and wordBreakSymbol, you get Grid Notation. The addition of edgeSymbol adds the parent/child concept.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">By convention those special symbols are:</p>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">nodeBreakSymbol
newline character
Keyboard: Enter Key
Binary: 00001010
Hex: 0A
Decimal: 10
As string: "\n"
(Note: On Windows, "\r" is treated the same as any other non-special char)</code>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">wordBreakSymbol
space character
Keyboard: Space Key
Binary: 00100000
Hex: 20
Decimal: 32
As string: " "</code>
<code class="scrollCodeBlock">edgeSymbol
# by convention is the same as wordBreakSymbol above</code>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For better interoperability with existing spreadsheet applications the tab character <code>\t</code> is often used for wordBreakSymbol and edgeSymbol.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Although in theory edgeSymbol and wordBreakSymbol can conflict, in practice, given a higher level Tree Language grammar, that does not happen.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This is currently the full spec of Scroll Notation.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 class="scrollParagraph">Tree Languages</h1>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The structure above defines Scroll Notation. Scroll Notation is a very basic notation. On top of Scroll Notation, people build <em>Tree Languages</em>. You can see examples of higher level Tree Languages in the <a href="https://sdk.scroll.pub/designer/">Tree Language Designer</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The <a href="https://sdk.scroll.pub/designer/#standard%20grammar">Grammar Language</a> is an advanced Tree Language for building other Tree Languages. This spec is written in a Tree Language called <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/master/scrolldown.grammar">Scroll</a>.</p>
