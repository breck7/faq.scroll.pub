# Introduction to Two Dimensional Languages

* Scroll Notation is a subset of a class of languages called two dimensional languages.

* One dimensional languages assume a one dimensional array of bits with a single read head
 moving in order.

* Two dimensional languages break those assumptions. There may be multiple read heads that
 can move not just on the x axis but on the y axis as well.

* Scroll Notation is a middle ground that utilitizes ideas from the two dimensional language
 world using present day technology.

# Scroll Notation Spec

## The Data Structure
* The basic structure of a Scroll Notation object is as follows:
code
 interface TreeNode {
   parent: &TreeNode
   words: string[]
   children: TreeNode[]
 }

## No Syntax Errors
* All documents are valid Scroll Notation documents. Like binary notation, there are no syntax errors in Scroll Notation. For every possible string _abc_:
code
 new TreeNode(abc).toString() === abc

* Errors can only occur at a higher semantic level in _Tree Languages_.

## Isomorphism to Spreadsheets
* A program in Scroll Notation is isomorphic to a spreadsheet. A single row is a node. Words are in cells. You can make a row a child of the row above it by indenting it with an additional blank cell in the head.

## Special Symbols
* A Scroll Notation object is a sequence of bits/bytes/characters(hereafter abbreviated as chars). Scroll Notation requires the definition of 3 special chars, which turn an otherwise unstructured linear sequence of chars into a structured recursive tree object.

* Those 3 special chars are:
- nodeBreakSymbol
- wordBreakSymbol
- edgeSymbol

* *nodeBreakSymbol* delimits nodes (lines), *wordBreakSymbol* delimits words (cells), and *edgeSymbol* is used to indicate the parent/child relationship between nodes.

* With just nodeBreakSymbol and wordBreakSymbol, you get Grid Notation. The addition of edgeSymbol adds the parent/child concept.

* By convention those special symbols are:

code
 nodeBreakSymbol
 newline character
 Keyboard: Enter Key
 Binary: 00001010
 Hex: 0A
 Decimal: 10
 As string: "\n"
 (Note: On Windows, "\r" is treated the same as any other non-special char)

code
 wordBreakSymbol
 space character
 Keyboard: Space Key
 Binary: 00100000
 Hex: 20
 Decimal: 32
 As string: " "

code
 edgeSymbol
 # by convention is the same as wordBreakSymbol above

* For better interoperability with existing spreadsheet applications the tab character `\t` is often used for wordBreakSymbol and edgeSymbol.

* Although in theory edgeSymbol and wordBreakSymbol can conflict, in practice, given a higher level Tree Language grammar, that does not happen.

* This is currently the full spec of Scroll Notation.

# Tree Languages
* The structure above defines Scroll Notation. Scroll Notation is a very basic notation. On top of Scroll Notation, people build _Tree Languages_. You can see examples of higher level Tree Languages in the Tree Language Designer.

* The Grammar Language is an advanced Tree Language for building other Tree Languages. This spec is written in a Tree Language called Scroll.
